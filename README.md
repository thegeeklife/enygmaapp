# Context of the App
The purpose of this project is to create a web application that will bring communities of sleuths together by breaking down geographical barriers and connecting them everywhere, giving them the ability to interact with others, discuss theories and work their way to a solution building off of each otherâ€™s ideas. 

A theme that is common across real life cold cases and solving mysteries leisurely is that a lot of papers, boards and evidence are looked at, this means physical requirements for space are large and it may exclude some people from being able to participate. It is also easy to misplace documents if they are not organized as well. These physical constraint issues can be addressed by using a web application.
